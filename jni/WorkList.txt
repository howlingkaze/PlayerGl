-- 30 Days development memo --

2014/04/22

Before start :

Today's aim is to make the current codes more clean and readable. 

To do list:

1. Rearrange the code of the JNI parts, make sure all the .SO lib can work.
2. Design the APPS whole architecture.  Confirm the the function of each parts.
3. Follow the TDD rules, let the follower can take over my works easier. 
4. Add pause and resume function on MediaDecoder.
5. Rearrange the Output Surface code, add the JNI class.

After one week fool around. I am ready to work. 
Today's goal is finishing OutputSurface Rearrangement.


2014/05/12

Outputsurface determine the frame size(offscreen-render target).

The real display surface used to display the result is defined in layout xml. 
Which the size of its buffer can be change on your need. As long as its match the W/H ratio of the input video

To do list:
1. Design the decode-->Post process(fragment shader or something else) --> display  architecture take these two states into consideration.
2. Close the decoder right after the end of the video.  <==
